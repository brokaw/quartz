We went to West Texas in November. Turns out it was an ideal time to go: cool at night, and the midday sun was not strong enough to be miserable.

We stayed at El Cosmico in Marfa for a couple of nights. Here is the inside of one of the tipis. Plenty of space and a fire pit to boot.

Finding the desk at Sul Ross in Alpine was harder than we expected. It was pretty far, and we felt lost a couple of times. We pressed on and eventually found it.
