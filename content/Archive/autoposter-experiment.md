I set up an auto poster that will post content from my personal site to Facebook and Twitter. I’d like to make everything originate on my site and get pushed out to other places. I don’t want to be obnoxious about it though. My pet peeve is a tweet that links to a Facebook post. We’ll see how it goes.
