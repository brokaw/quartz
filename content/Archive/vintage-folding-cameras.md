A couple of folding cameras we inherited.

The one on the right is an Agfa.
I donâ€™t know what the one on the left is.
The lens is a Rodenstock.
The shutter is a Pronto, made by Gauthier.
The AGC logo apparently stands for Alfred Gauthier Calmbach, and also refers to the shutter (the shutter people sure got a lot of branding on this camera).
