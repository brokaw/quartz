[Ed Sheeran Deletes His Twitter Account After ‘Game of Thrones’ Cameo Gets Mixed Reaction](https://www.yahoo.com/music/ed-sheeran-deletes-twitter-account-065316161.html)

> While some people were delighted to spot music star Ed Sheeran in Sunday night’s Game of Thrones season seven premiere, others were less enthusiastic, arguing that the singer’s cameo struck a jarring note in the show’s fantasy world.

I’m a big _Game of Thrones_ fan, but never heard of Ed Sheeran, much less knew his face or voice. The thing that stuck out at me was not the extraneous singing, but the excessive _niceness_ of the Lannister soldiers. There is no precedent for a crew of such squeaky-clean soldiers. That was outrageous. But the Ed Sheeran cameo? That fit right in.
