I’ve been reading about [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) and the goal of publishing on my own site and syndicating the content out, or [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). I’ve had a personal blog for years, but never really posted to it much. Never as much as Facebook. In part, this is an attempt to break out of those networks. Or at least de-emphasize them.

My current attempt is the [SNAP](https://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-auto-poster-for-wordpress/) plugin on WordPress. It’s going ok. I like that it doesn’t brand itself when posting. It’s my Facebook app that has permission to post. It has pretty good customization of the post format.

I’d like the ability to customize the post format based on the WordPress post type. The template for a Photo post should be different from a Link, which should be different from a long text article. I’d also like is a way to pull in links to article I’ve _liked_, or retweeted. It looks like I’ll have to use another tool for that.
