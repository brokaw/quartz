iA Writer just [updated to version 5.5](https://ia.net/topics/new-pdf-preview-better-web-publishing-improved-editing). This looks like a significant update, with one big feature that affects me: better support for self-hosted WordPress sites. Previous versions required the Jetpack plugin, which I [balked at using](https://steven.brokaw.org/posts/ulysses-vs-ia-writer). Now I can use the [IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/WordPress_IndieAuth_Plugin) [plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/). The [OAuth2 plugin](https://github.com/WP-API/OAuth2) is also supported with a little more configuration.

This is my first post with iA Writer 5.5. It took me a couple of tries to get the plugin to work–documentation is scarce. But it works as advertised. Here’s hoping it leads to more posts here.
