I’ve gone back and forth from static site generators, like Jekyll and Hugo, to hosted sites like Wordpress, which is the current platform. One of the benefits of static site generators is the ability to write posts in markdown and keep my content in a git repository. The advantage of Wordpress is the ecosystem around it. There is a plugin for just about everything, and good themes are easy to find.

This is my latest attempt to have my cake and eat it too. I wrote a script to turn a markdown file into HTML and post the result to Wordpress. I don’t have a good way to post photos, and I don’t have a way to update the post. At this this will help me see if the writing method was really hindering my posting, or whether that was just an excuse.
