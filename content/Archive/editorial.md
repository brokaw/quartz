It seems like I should be able to just write any old arbitrary thing on this blog every day. That hasn’t happened. So I started an editorial calendar in hopes of increasing my output. Nothing too complicated: just a place to list ideas and a calendar. When it’s time to write something, I pick something from this list and put it on the calendar.

I found a couple of tools to track this in Wordpress. [PublishPress](https://publishpress.com), [Edit Flow](https://editflow.org), and [Editorial Calendar](https://stresslimitdesign.com/editorial-calendar-plugin/) are the ones I looked at. Other plugins have features to manage multiple writers and editors. I don’t need any of that.

In the end, I decided even these are too complicated. _Keep things as simple as possible, but no simpler_. So it it is with some irony that I chose to keep my calendar in [Airtable](https://airtable.com). Airtable isn’t too simple, but it’s complicated in ways I understand. My use of it is pretty simple, and I can grow to a more complicated workflow if I need to. The key is to avoid prematurely adding complexity. If I’m successful with Airtable, I’ll post more details about my workflow
