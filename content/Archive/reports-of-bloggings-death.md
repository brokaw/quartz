Jia Tolentino at the New Yorker [laments that blogging is over](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-end-of-the-awl-and-the-vanishing-of-freedom-and-fun-from-the-internet):

> Blogging, that much-maligned pastime, is gradually but surely disappearing from the Internet, and so, consequently, is a lot of online freedom and fun.

As evidence she cites the closing of

- Grantland
- Toast
- Gawker
- Gothamist
- Awl & Hairpin

Now [here](https://gist.github.com/jvns/26dbe9b84694362d9fc6c6fccbd05048) is a list of honest to goodness blogs, curated by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca). Where did I find this list? At [Scripting News](http://scripting.com), a blog.
