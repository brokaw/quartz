I’m in a period of Japanophilia. Recently the Austin Film Society showed all six installments of _Lone Wolf and Cub_, which were excellent.

This weekend they’re playing _Lady Snowblood_. I have never seen it but am very excited. Apparently it’s an inspiration for _Kill Bill_, but I won’t hold that against it.
