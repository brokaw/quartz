From the BBC: [The Hidden Ways that Architecture Affects How You Feel.](https://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170605-the-psychology-behind-your-citys-design)

> One thing that is guaranteed to make people feel negative about living in a city is a constant sense of being lost or disorientated. Some cities are easier to navigate than others — New York’s grid-like street pattern makes it relatively straightforward, whereas London, with its hotchpotch of neighbourhoods all orientated differently and the Thames meandering through the middle, is notoriously confusing.

I can speak to neither New York (which I found confusing), nor to London, but the Hyde Park neighborhood is one of Austin’s more walkable neighborhoods, and it is built on a pretty rigid grid.
