In the spirit of supporting our local business during the pandemic, we signed up for a cheese-tasing course with [Antonelli’s](https://www.antonellischeese.com). We picked up a half pound of cheese from their shop: a pre-selected sampling of seven different cheeses. Then we embellished it with a little prosciutto, Castelvetrano olives, a baguette, and some wine. We then tuned into their video stream while they talked us through the full tasting menu. It was great, especially considering they had never streamed a tasting before and rushed into it with about a week’s preparation.
