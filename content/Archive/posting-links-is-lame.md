The last couple of posts I made went to Facebook as links back to my site. That is not how I meant things to go. I’m not trying to drive traffic to my site. I don’t even have any traffic analytics installed. I just want this to show up in the timeline.

Hopefully, the full text of this post will appear on Facebook. You can read it in its entirety in your timeline, and never visit my site. That it he goal.
