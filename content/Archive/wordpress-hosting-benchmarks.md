If you’ve ever tried to research web hosting, you’re probably noticed the disreputable nature of hosting reviews. Most review sites are riddled with affiliate links, which calls into question all the reviews and ratings.

When I was shopping for managed WordPress hosting, one site I’ve come to trust is Review Signal. They now have a [2018 edition of their WordPress hosting benchmarks](https://reviewsignal.com/blog/wordpress-hosting-performance-benchmarks-2018/). I have a [Lightning Base](https://lightningbase.com) account based on their recommendation, and I’m very happy with it. I had never heard about the company before I read about them in Review Signal.

I’ve also tried [Pressable](https://pressable.com). They rank highly, and their interface was nicer than Lighting Base. They are also a Texas comany. But I only have one site I really need top-tier hosting for, and Lightning Base had better pricing for that use case.
