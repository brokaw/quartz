Every so often I gather the strength and resolve to try to get a Wordpress theme that does what I want. I want it to:

- Not look terrible–mostly minimal, optimized for reading text, but enough photo support for the occasional gallery post
- Support latest standards like micro formats
- Responsive, but no hamburger menus in the full size view
- Use the Wordpress content formats to appropriately style an _aside_ as an inline Twitter-style post

Finally, I always end up wanting to make this interop with Twitter and Facebook.

Right now I’m using a theme that hasn’t been updated in years, so I need to find an update. I am not particularly looking forward to it.
