I keep thinking about [this tweet from Garry Kasparov](https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/787333685146226688):

> Saying that fair elections are rigged is as much a crime against democracy as saying that rigged elections are fair.

Itâ€™s an odd twist that Trump is casting doubt on an election that he legally won (even if it was with a national minority). I attribute that to a strategy of working the ref. The lie of voter fraud is groundwork on propaganda that will be needed in future efforts to suppress voting rights.

It also made me think the same idea applies to the news: Saying that fair journalism is biased is as much a crime against truth as saying that biased journalism is fair.
